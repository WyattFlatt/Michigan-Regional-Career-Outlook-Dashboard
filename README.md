# Michigan Regional Career Outlook Dashboard

## Overview
This project documents the design and development of an interactive Power BI
dashboard created for the **State of Michigan** to provide clear, accessible
information about **in-demand occupations** for students, jobseekers, educators,
and policymakers.

The dashboard is publicly hosted on a Michigan government website and is intended
to support workforce planning, career exploration, and policy decision-making
through data-driven insights.

## Role & Contribution
Besides style suggestions for the homepage, I was the sole developer of this dashboard 
and was responsible for the end-to-end design and implementation, including data modeling,
analytics, Power BI development, and accessibility compliance.
